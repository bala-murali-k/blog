					In this article we are going to know how to open file manager in linux using Terminal. <br /> <br />

					Step 1: Open the terminal using the shortcut <strong>"ctrl + alt + t</strong>. <br /> <br />
					Step 2: Run the command <strong>xdg-open /home</strong>. <br /> <br />

					This command will open your new file manager in the home directory where you can see the profile/account folders on your linux system. <br /> <br />

					You can also use <strong>xdg-open /home/linux</strong>(profile/accout - linux in my case) to open directly to your profile just like you freshly open a file manager using the GUI. <br /> <br />

					I used it on debian and it worked, But I don't know about the other types like arch or red hat and so on. <br /> <br />

					Hello everyone, I'm a type of person who loves to work in a terminal or cmd. So at some point I wanted to open the file manager application using the terminal without moving my hand from the keyboard. So I searched the internet to open files application using terminal, most of the result said that I need to use <strong>cat</strong> command to open files inside the terminal. I'm extremely disappointed with the result, So I decided to include this command here so I can quickly refer back to it whenever needed (Just in case I forget). <br /> <br />

					If you want to share how this command worked in your distribution or improve the content just fork the repository from the github using <a href="https://github.com/bala-murali-k/blog.git" target="_blank">repo</a>, move to the directory <code>blog/languages/Linux/HowTo/open-files-application</code> and update the content of <code>main.html</code>.
