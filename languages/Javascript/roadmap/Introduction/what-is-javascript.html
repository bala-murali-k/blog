					Here we are just looking at the introduction of javascript not the history (will be learned later on). <br /> <br />

					The javascript is a light weighted, interpreted, single threaded, dynamically typed scripting language. It is the core technology of the web. It makes the internet more engaging and alive by adding interactivity to the websites. <br /> <br />

					Javascript's strength lies in it's ability to run in a browser allowing developers to create applications that are interactive and more engaging web application by, <br />

						<ol>
							<li>Adding Interactivity to the website</li>
							<li>Create API</li>
							<li>Communicate between websites</li>
							<li>Manipulating DOM</li>
							<li>Manipulating Styles of the Website</li>
							<li>Manipulate Strings/Data from the user</li>
							<li>Store data inside the browser</li>
						</ol>

					Other than these web related uses we can also create games, Mobile apps and Desktop apps. The javascript can be executed by an special program called javascript engine which is present in all browser which make the javascript more popular as it can run in almost all devices.
