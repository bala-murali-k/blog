				<h3> What is software development life cycle? </h3>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p>
					The software development is a process of planning, writing, modifying and maintaining software. The main goal of SDLC is to minimize the risks long before deciding how to launch the product and ensure the project meets the customer's expectations on both during and after the production.

					<h3>Note: </h3>The term "life cycle" was first used in 1950's and 1960's for the stages involved in developing a new computer system. Now it is commonly used to refer all stages in the production of any type of software.

					<li>Increased visiblity of the development process for all stake holders involved.</li>
					<li>Understanding the requirements and the goal of the software.</li>
					<li>Identify risks at early stage to improve risk management and cost estimation.</li>
					<li>A systemetic approach to delivering software that meets customer satisfaction such as building prototypes or writing functional specifications.</li>
					<li>Track the progress on goals.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Generally there is seven stages in software development life cycle. Each stage has it's own set of activities that the team members need to do, where the timeline can be vary from project to project but generally follow these phase. The SDLC process can be a little different for every team and product. Let's look at the seven phases.

				<h3>Phase 1: Planning and Analysis</h3>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p>
					The first step in the software development life cycle is planning. It is where you gather buisness requirements from client and stake holders, set goals, identify risks and brainstorm ideas. Here the team will work together to devise a set of buisness goals, requirements, specifications, and any high level risks that might hinder the project success.  

					To properly decide what to make and what not to make, we can use a "feature prioritization framework" that takes into account of the software, the cost, the time it takes to build and other factors.

				<h3>Phase 2: Analyze requirements</h3>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p>
					This phase is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team (tasks). This requires a lot of research and planning to create a detailed project plan document and work breakdown structure that outline the requirements ensuring that the project meets all the expectations.

					This process guides the development of several important documents: SRS - software requirement specification, use case document and requirement traceability matrix document.

				<h3>Phase 3: Design</h3>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p>
					The original plan and vision are eloborated into a software design document (SDD) which includes system design, programming language, templates, platform to use and application security measures. Here is also where we flowchart how the software behaves when there is an action.

					The design phase will include the development of the prototype model, a pre-produced product that give the opportunity to visualise the project and change without the hazzle of rewritting the code.
